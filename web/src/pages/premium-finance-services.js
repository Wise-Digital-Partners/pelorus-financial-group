                Many individuals understand the traditional way to design and
                pay for permanent life insurance through cash payments over
                time. Utilizing the same life insurance policies but integrating
                a premium finance services strategy, our firm is uniquely
                positioned to demonstrate a much more advantageous option. In
                comparing these two strategies side-by-side, clients gain the
                knowledge they need to make a well-informed decision.

                    Clients usually understand the most common way to purchase
                    life insurance â€“ with cash payments. What many clients do
                    not understand is that an alternative funding method is
                    available using Premium Financing.

                    By comparing the two options side-by-side, clients can make
                    a well-informed decision and understand the benefits of our
                    life insurance carrier-approved funding method. If you
                    decide not to implement the strategy after you analyze both

                    Once you have identified a client who qualifies, contact our
                    office to discuss the potential opportunity. If premium
                    financing seems suitable, we have a one-page trial
                    application requesting medical and financial information
                    from the client. Our office can provide a preliminary
                    premium finance case design within 48 hours. After which, we
                    will review the case design with you to present the option
                    to the client.

                    If you need in-person or teleconference sales support, one
                    of our team members can assist you. If the client decides to
                    proceed with premium financing, process the financial
                    approval concurrently with our insurance medical approval.
                    When both offers are in place, we assist with the loan
                    documents, collateral assignment forms and book the case in
                    our system to review with you and your client annually.
